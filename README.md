# 🧠 Psychology for Data Science  
_A Journey to Understand Humans with Data_

---

## 📍 About This Repository

This repository documents my personal learning journey of combining **Psychology + Data Science**.

The goal is to explore how humans think, behave, decide, feel, and interact — and how these patterns can be **analyzed, measured, predicted, and modeled using data.**

This project will include:

- 📚 Daily learning notes  
- 🧪 Behavioral experiments  
- 📊 Data visualizations  
- 🤖 Machine learning and NLP based emotional/behavior models  
- 🧠 Psychology-based case studies

## 🎯 Why Combine Psychology & Data Science?

Most datasets tell us **what happened**.  
Psychology helps us understand **why it happened**.

Together, they unlock powerful applications like:

- 🧾 Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube)
- 📈 Consumer behavior & market analytics
- 🎭 UX and user journey optimization
- 💬 Sentiment & emotion analysis (NLP)
- ❤️ Mental health technology & well-being analytics
- 🧑‍💼 Organizational / HR analytics
- 🤖 Cognitive & affective AI systems

Technology understands data.  
Psychology understands people.  
**Future innovation requires both.**
