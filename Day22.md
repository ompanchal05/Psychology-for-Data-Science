## 🧩 PART 1 — Your FINAL CAPSTONE (Conceptual)

You don’t need to code today.  
You need **clarity**.

### 🧠 Capstone Title (Use This)

> **“Understanding & Predicting Human Behavior Using Psychology-Driven Data Science”**

---

## 🔬 Capstone Problem Statement

You now understand **ALL of these**.

## 🧠 PART 2 — How You Explain Yourself (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🎤 Your Identity Statement (Memorize This)
