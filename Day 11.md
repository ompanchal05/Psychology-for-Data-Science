# 🧠 Day 11 — Cognitive Biases & Human Decision-Making (Psychology for Data Scientists)

## 📍 Why This Topic?

Humans do NOT make decisions logically.  
Most decisions come from:

- shortcuts  
- emotions  
- habits  
- biases  

For a data scientist, understanding biases is ESSENTIAL because:

➡️ Bias explains WHY data patterns look the way they do.  
➡️ User data is NEVER 100% rational.  
➡️ Product experiments (A/B tests) depend on human psychology.  
➡️ Companies use biases to influence decisions (ethically).

# 🔥 What Are Cognitive Biases?

Cognitive biases are:

> **Patterns where the brain makes decisions automatically, quickly, and sometimes incorrectly.**

These shortcuts save time, but create predictable behavior.

Machine learning LOVES predictable human behavior → better predictions.

# ⭐ TOP 7 Biases Every Data Scientist Must Know

---

## 1️⃣ Confirmation Bias  
People search for information that matches their beliefs.

➡️ Users click what they **already** like.  
➡️ Algorithms reinforce this behavior → filter bubbles.

📌 Example:  
If someone likes fitness content, YouTube keeps showing fitness videos.

---

## 2️⃣ Anchoring Bias  
The first number or information we see influences all future decisions.

📌 Example:  
₹999 seems cheaper than ₹1000 because of anchoring.

Data science use case:
- Price optimization  
- E-commerce A/B testing  

---

## 3️⃣ Availability Bias  
People judge things based on what they remember easily.

📌 Example:  
One viral negative video → everyone thinks the brand is bad.

Use Case:
- Sentiment analysis  
- Brand monitoring algorithms  

---

## 4️⃣ Social Proof Bias  
People follow what others are doing.

📌 Example:  
“10,000 people bought this today.”

Use Case:
- Recommendation systems  
- Trending product systems  
- Influencer analytics  

---

## 5️⃣ Loss Aversion  
People hate losing more than they love winning.

📌 Example:
“Only 2 seats left!”  
“Offer ending soon!”

Use Case:
- Marketing strategy  
- Retention models  
- Churn prediction  

---

## 6️⃣ Recency Bias  
People focus more on recent events.

📌 Example:  
You watch one cooking reel → Instagram shows more cooking today.

Use Case:
- Short-term trend prediction  
- Content recommendation algorithms  

---

## 7️⃣ Habit Bias  
People repeat actions that require the least effort.

Use Case:
- User journey design  
- Behavioral clustering  
- Habit loop modeling (Day 4)

---

# 🧠 Why Biases Matter in Real Company Data?

Because users:

✔️ Don't choose the "best" option  
✔️ Choose the *easiest* option  
✔️ Choose the *quickest* option  
✔️ Often choose what they saw *first*  
✔️ Choose what others choose  

This explains MANY real-world data patterns.

# 📊 Data Science Use Cases

| Bias | Data Science Impact |
|------|----------------------|
| Anchoring | Price optimization, A/B testing |
| Social proof | Viral growth prediction |
| Recency | Recommender systems |
| Confirmation | Filter bubble detection |
| Loss aversion | Retention strategy |
| Habit bias | Behavior clustering |
| Availability | Sentiment models |

Psychology literally explains WHY your ML model behaves as it does.

# 🤖 How ML + Bias Work Together

Example:

If users click content similar to what they liked before → ML learns the pattern → sends more of it.

This happens because of:

- Confirmation bias  
- Habit bias  
- Recency bias  

Your model reflects **human psychology**.

---

# 🧠 Simple Summary

> “Cognitive biases create predictable human patterns — data science learns and models those patterns.”

---

# ✨ Reflection for Day 11

Answer honestly:

1. Which bias do *I* have the most?  
2. Which bias do I see in apps like YouTube/Instagram?  
3. Which bias do I want to study more?  
4. How can I use this knowledge in ML models?
