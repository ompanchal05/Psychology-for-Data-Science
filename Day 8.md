## 📍 Why This Topic Matters

Understanding **self-esteem and identity** helps us grow stronger mentally.

## 🌱 What is Self-Esteem?

Self-esteem means:

> **How much you value, respect, and believe in yourself.**

It’s basically your internal belief:

✔️ "I am capable."  
✔️ "I deserve good things."  
✔️ "I can handle challenges."

---

## 📊 Types of Self-Esteem

| Type | Meaning | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Healthy Self-Esteem** | Balanced confidence | You believe in yourself but stay humble |
| **Low Self-Esteem** | Doubts, insecurity | Fear, comparison, negative self-talk |
| **False / Inflated Self-Esteem** | Ego, external validation | Needs compliments to feel worthy |

The goal is **healthy confidence**, not ego, and not insecurity.

## 🧠 How Self-Esteem Forms

Self-esteem develops from:

✔️ Childhood experiences  
✔️ Achievements  
✔️ Failures  
✔️ Relationships  
✔️ Self-talk  
✔️ Environment  

You are not born with confidence —  
you **build it.**

---

## 🧩 Identity: “Who am I?”

Identity is your answer to:

> **Who am I as a person?**

It includes:

- Personality  
- Values  
- Beliefs  
- Culture  
- Aspirations  
- Strengths & Weaknesses  

When identity becomes clear → confidence increases.

## 🧠 The Inner Voice (Self-Talk)

Everyone has a voice in their mind.

There are two types:

| Self-Talk Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Negative | "I'm not good enough." / "If I fail, people will judge me." |
| Positive | "I can improve." / "I deserve opportunities." |

Your brain listens to whatever you repeat.

So confidence builds through:

✔️ Repetition  
✔️ Action  
✔️ Improvement

## 🛠 How Confidence Grows (Psychology Rule)

Confidence = **Doing → Learning → Improving → Repeating**

Not waiting.

People think confidence comes **before** action.  
But psychology shows confidence comes **after** action.
