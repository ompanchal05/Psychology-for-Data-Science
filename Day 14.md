# 🧠 Day 14 — A/B Testing & Human Bias (Psychology for Data Scientists)

## 📍 Why This Topic Matters

A/B testing is not just statistics.

It is:
> **Testing human behavior in controlled experiments.**

If you don’t understand psychology, your A/B test conclusions can be WRONG.

---

## 🔬 What is A/B Testing? (Simple)

A/B testing means:
- Show **Version A** to some users
- Show **Version B** to other users
- Measure which performs better

Example:
- Button color A vs B
- Price A vs B
- Layout A vs B

## 🧠 The Psychological Side of A/B Tests

Users are not robots.

Their behavior is influenced by:
- Biases
- Emotions
- Habits
- Context
- Expectations

Ignoring this = misleading results.

## ⭐ Common Human Biases That Affect A/B Tests

---

### 1️⃣ Novelty Effect
People like **new things** at first.

📌 Example:
New UI gets more clicks for 3 days → then drops.

⚠️ Mistake:
Ending test too early.

---

### 2️⃣ Priming Bias
What users saw earlier affects current decisions.

📌 Example:
Showing discount first → product looks cheaper.

---

### 3️⃣ Framing Effect
Same information, different presentation → different reaction.

📌 Example:
- “Save ₹500” vs “20% off”

---

### 4️⃣ Social Proof Bias
People copy others.

📌 Example:
“Most popular choice” increases clicks.

---

### 5️⃣ Loss Aversion
Fear of losing is stronger than desire to gain.

📌 Example:
“Offer ends today” beats “New offer available”.

---

### 6️⃣ Anchoring Bias
First number seen affects later judgment.

📌 Example:
₹1999 → ₹999 feels cheap.
